# IBM ❤️ Open Source AI

IBM is building enterprise-focused foundation models to drive the future of business. The Granite family of foundation models span a variety of modalities, including language, code, and other modalities, such as time series.

We strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development to propel AI forward. As such, we will be releasing our latest open innovations on this IBM-Granite GitHub organization page with model weights on our [Hugging Face organization](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite). We hope that the AI community will find our efforts useful and that our models help fuel their research.

If you have any questions, please visit our [discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/ibm-granite/discussions).
